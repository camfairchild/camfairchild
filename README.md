Hi, I'm Cameron Fairchild, a student at the University of Toronto, currently entering my third-year. 
I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. 
I am interested in becoming a software developer, but I hope to eventually transition to a role in management.  

I have learned and used multiple languages and frameworks, including:  
- Java
  - JavaFX
- C
- JavaScript (ES6)
  - NodeJS & ExpressJS
    - Mocha & Chai
  - ReactJS
- MongoDB (MongooseJS)
- Python (2/3)
  - pytest
- HTML
- MIPS ASM
- SQL (postgreSQL)

However, I am always looking to learn more new and exciting technologies.  
I am currently looking for a PEY (co-op) position starting May or September 2022, and I am open to any opportunity to learn!
